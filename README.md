## What are ANNs?
The brain has over 100 billion neurons communicating through electrical and chemical signals. Neurons communicate with each other and help us see, think, and generate ideas.
Human brain learns by creating connections among these neurons. ANNs are information processing models inspired by the human brain.

Backpropagation is a method used to train ANNs by calculating gradient needed to update network weights.
It is commonly used by the gradient descent optimization algorithm to adjust the weight of neurons by calculating the gradient of the loss function.
